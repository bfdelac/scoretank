<H1>ScoreTank privacy</H1>
ScoreTank does not store any user information other than the user IDs that correspond to various roles in the competition (eg administrator, team member), and it will ask you first before storing your user ID.  You may bookmark your team's page and continue to view it without giving ScoreTank your user ID.  Privacy: ScoreTank will not divulge your user ID to any party, other than (with your approval) displaying your status as a team member, competition admin etc within the ScoreTank application.
